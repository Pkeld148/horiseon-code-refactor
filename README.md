# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

The goal of this project was to refactor the Horiseon webpage to improve its accessibility.  The majority of the changes made were to modify "div" tags into semantic elements.  Additionally, all of the redundancy found in the style.css sheet was removed and all items re-arranged in a more appropriate order.  Images were given "alt" tags and the code was formatted using the extension Prettier.


## Installation

To install, the user will need to navigate to and clone the repository found at:

## Usage
